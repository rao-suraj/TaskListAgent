  #   Converse with human to understand their needs for the project {user_input} and translate them into Product Requirements Document and Technical Requirements Document. Ask 
  #   human relevant questions regarding function and tech stack if not specified using human interaction tool. Try to keep questions asked to human less then 3 and group related question together.
  #   At the end ask for human confirmation by providing the documents using human interaction tool ones the documents are ready. after confirmation give final output.
  goal: >
    Converse with human for the project related input
    <human_input>
    {user_input}
    </human_input>
    and understand the project function, non functional and technical requirements and create Product Requirements Document and Technical Requirements Document.
    <instructions>
      1.IMPROTANT: Ask human relevant questions regarding function and tech stack if not specified using human interaction tool. Don't assume features and tech stack by yourself 
      2.IMPORTANT: Group related question together for reducing the number of questions.
      3.IMPORTANT: At the end ask for human confirmation by providing the documents using human interaction. Then provide the final output.

    Project Overview
      Purpose: Why are we building this?
      Example: "Create a phone usage tracking app to help users monitor and manage their screen time."
    Goals and Objectives
      Desired outcomes from a business perspective.
      Example: "Help users understand their phone habits and reduce excessive screen time."
    Stakeholders
      Who's involved or benefits.
      Example: "Target users: Phone owners; Client: App owner seeking usage insights."
    User Stories
      Simple needs from the user's view.
      Example: "As a user, I want to see how much time I spend on apps daily so I can manage my usage."
    Functional Requirements
      What the app should do (no tech details).
      Example:
        "Show daily phone usage by app."
        "Let users set time limits and get alerts."
    Non-Functional Requirements
      General quality expectations.
      Example:
        "App should be easy to use."
        "Should work on most modern phones."
    Assumptions and Constraints
      High-level limits or conditions.
      Example: "Assumes users allow access to usage data; focused on one phone platform initially."

    <technical_requirements_document_structure>
     Tech Stack
      Required technologies for the project.
      Example: "Frontend: React Native; Backend: Node.js; Database: MongoDB."
      Example: "Frontend: Decide base on requirement; Backend: Django; Database: MySQL."
     Third-Party Services
      External tools or APIs needed.
      Example: "Google Firebase for push notifications."
      Example: "CAMS and karvy for eKyc and Mutual Fund Details."

    <human_input>
    {user_input}
    </human_input> 
    and develop a Software Design Document, Development Workflow Plan and Order of execution.
    <instruction>
    1.Do not add any thing new example feature, module or tech that is not mentioned in Projecct Requirements Document and Technical Requirements Document.
    2.IMPORTANT: Include Detailed execution plan in Development Workflow Plan.
      Example: Wrong "use Payment gateway for payment" Correct "Integrate Razorpay API for payment"

    Project Overview: Purpose and goals 
      Example:"Track phone usage time to reduce screen time"
    Architecture: High-level system design 
      Example:"Frontend: React Native; Backend: Node.js"
    Modules: Key components and their functions 
      Example: "Usage tracking module: Query and store app usage data"
    API: List of Api that needs to be created.
      Example: - **POST /api/transactions:** Add a new transaction.
               - **GET /api/transactions:** Retrieve all transactions.
               - **GET /api/reports:** Generate and retrieve reports.
    You can add sections based on the type of project.

    <development_workflow_plan_structure>
    Feature Overview: What the component does (e.g., "Track phone usage time").
    Tech Stack: Tools/APIs/Third party services per layer (e.g., "Android UsageStatsManager API - Frontend, SQLite - Backend", BSE API - For getting Fund Details & Purchase).
    Execution Process: Ordered steps with Frontend/Backend labels and effort estimates:
    Step 1: Query usage data via Android API
    Step 2: Store data locally in SQLite 
    Step 3: Sync data to backend via REST API
    Dependencies: Whats needed first (e.g., "Android permissions setup").
    Assumptions/Risks: Clarify limits (e.g., "No backend API for usage tracking; relies on Android API").
    for all modules and features mentioned in the Software Design Document.

    <order_of_execution_structure>
    A logical sequence of tasks  
      Example:"Set up database schema before building API endpoints"
